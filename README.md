1. Start with the UI.
- add a link to edit/update a cat (in the cat details page)
- add a link to delete a cat (in the cat details page)

2. Add a path in urls.py for any UI changes that involve a new route.
- add a path() for cats_update in urls.py
- add a path() for cats_delete in urls.py

3. Add view functions for the new URLs in views.py
- add a view function for cats_update
- add a view function for cats_delete
